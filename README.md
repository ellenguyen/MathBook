# Introduction
As a Mathematics Undergraduate Fellow, I present to you **Mathbook**. This serves as a review guidebook for Temple MATH 0702 students.

# Objectives
While there are numerous existing resources for students to improve their Math skills, many focus heavily on problem solving rather than supporting review and mastery of course materials. Therefore, this proposal aims to provide a platform that enables students to easily access and learn from Math notes tailored specifically to the curriculum of Temple's MATH 0702 course.

# Contribution
Developing this platform involves a direct collaboration and consultation from **Dr. Maria Lorenz** and **Professor Jessica Babcock** to design a distinctive set of features that go beyond simply solving Math problems. This will fill an important gap by facilitating comprehension and retention of the core concepts and procedures covered in the class.

# Questions?
Please feel free to contact me at linh.nguyen0029@temple.edu if you have any questions or would like to discuss the project further. 

> With our combined knowledge and skills, I am confident we can develop an accessible, user-friendly platform that will deliver significant value to MATH 0702 learners.
